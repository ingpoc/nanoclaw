• 1. Timestamp-only cursor can skip messages: Store/process cursor as (timestamp, message_id) and query with deterministic tie-break ordering; impact: eliminates silent message loss when multiple messages share the same timestamp.
  2. IPC delivery is not atomic (send vs ack/delete): Add idempotency keys + persisted delivery ledger (or transactional inbox/outbox) before file deletion; impact: prevents duplicate cross-group actions after crashes/restarts.
  3. IPC source identity is filesystem-trust only: Sign IPC payloads (HMAC per group/service key) and verify before processing; impact: blocks spoofed IPC requests from compromised/misplaced writers.
  4. SQLite FK integrity is implicit: Enable PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON on DB init and add startup assertion/test; impact: enforces referential integrity and prevents orphaned/corrupt relational state.
  5. Unbounded container output parse buffer: Add max buffer size + timeout/fail-fast when markers are malformed/missing; impact: avoids unbounded memory growth and stuck runs under bad output streams.
  6. Credential minimization is partial: Reduce mounted secrets to per-role minimum and use short-lived scoped tokens where possible; impact: shrinks blast radius if an agent reads exposed auth material.
  7. Minimal-surface vision has scope drift: Move advanced worker-lane/multi-channel behavior behind explicit feature modules/flags with core kept lean; impact: restores original “small understandable core” and lowers maintenance complexity.
